# Secure Software Engineering Process
Date: 20200203

This week there will be discussion of process in secure software engineering.

Security is often a software issue. There are many reports of how poor software development quality becomes a top threat. Some recent examples are CVE-2014-0160 heartbleed, CVE-2015-6271 shellshock.

There are few sources of software insecurities:
* Complexities
* Incorrect assumption by engineers
* Flawed specs
* Component of execution env
* Unintened interaction between software components

Software Development Stages are as follow:
* Requirement
* Analysis
* Design
* Implementation
* Verfication
* Maintenance

There are some evolutions of software development process
* Waterfall model. No feedback loop. Old school.
* Rapid prototyping
* Iterative and incrementel: Agile!

Agile Manifesto:
* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive docs
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan
That is, while there is a value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

Secure Software Development.
> “Software development is not yet a science or a rigorous discipline, and the development process by and large is not controlled to minimize the vulnerabilities that attackers exploit. Today, as with cancer, vulnerable software can be invaded and modified to cause damage to previously healthy software, and infected software can replicate itself and be carried across networks to cause damage in other systems. Like cancer, these damaging processes may be invisible to the lay person even though experts recognize that their threat is growing.”
From [Cyber Security: A Crisis of Prioritization, 2005 (page 9)](https://www.nitrd.gov/pubs/pitac/pitac_report_cybersecurity_2005.pdf)
