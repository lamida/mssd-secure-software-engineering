# 51.503 Secure Software Engineering

This is repository for lecture notes and relevant learning materials for [Secure Software Engineering](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/courses/mssd/secure-software-engineering/) course that I take as part of [Master Security in Security by Design (MSSD)](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/education/mssd/) in [Singapore University of Techology and Design](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/). The instructor of this module is [Cyrille Jegourel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyrille-jegourel-778a922b/).

Note: In this term, the instructor is ofsetting the week index with +1. E.g: week01 is considered as week02 by the instructor. However, I keep maintaining the note without ofset.
